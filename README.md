# Power-BI
Analyzed 160 years of Olympics data on various factors such as Sex, Country, Age, Medals and many more. 
To showcase my insights used various charts like bar chart, pi chart, line chart and a lot more. 
For good user-experience used various colors to represent certain categories such as Pink to showcase Female, Blue to showcase Male, Gold to represent Gold Medal and so on.
Also, used Bookmarks to make it interactive same as buttons work in web development.
